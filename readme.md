# Gufitrup - Experiment

**Important: I don't own any of the sprites used here and this is just an study experiment, nothing is for sale here!**

The Gufitrup Experiment is a Javascript Game created from scratch. My intention was to remake the old SNES game, Goof Troop, in pure Javascript with the intention on learning Game Development.

This is not a full game remake, it's just a sandbox where I could learn something about game mechanics and have fun in te proccess.

Fell free to ask me any question about it ou even teach me something, let's learn together. There is still a lot Work to do.
